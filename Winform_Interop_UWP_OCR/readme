Inter-Operation between Winform and UWP is not an easy job.
This program bridges them together, so Winfrom can share UWP power.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Start with installation (already done in this project):
https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/desktop-to-uwp-enhance

Efforts in this work:
(1) .Net Winform program can invoke UWP packages.
(2) UWP OCR function as sample.
(3) Change SoftwareBitmap to Bitmap and Bitmap to SoftwareBitmap as well.
